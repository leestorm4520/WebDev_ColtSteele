        Charles Xavier is a mutant gifted with vast telepathic powers, being a specialist in mutant biology and sociology and the founder of the uncanny X-Men as Professor X.[1] With immense support from Dr. Moira MacTaggert, his life has become dedicated to fulfill his dream of mutants and humans coexisting peacefully.[23][24][25] As a young man, he traveled around the world to better comprehend mutantkind, meeting a dear friend and ruthless rival, the man who would become known as Magneto.[26]
        <br>
After becoming paraplegic following a conflict against the villain Lucifer in the Himalayas,[27] Xavier transformed his family's ancestral home into the Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters, a sanctuary for mutants to train and learn about their abilities.[28] Under his supervision, Professor X's students formed the X-Men, a super-hero group who fight for a world that hates and fears them, guided by Xavier's dream. Through the years, Xavier and his X-Men entered into conflicts with both humans and mutants with diverging ideologies, especially Magneto, who believed in mutant supremacy.[1]
        <br>
In order to ensure the survival of mutantkind, Xavier eventually assumed a harsher stance on the mutant-human conflict. Influenced by Moira and assisted by Magneto, Professor X established a mutant nation on the living island of Krakoa, granting citizenship for all mutantkind. As a head of state of the mutant nation, Professor X is currently responsible for a much larger community than solely the X-Men, which comprises thousands of mutants.[29]
